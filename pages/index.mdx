# Introduction

Archie AI helps you search and ask questions about code base in natural language. In addition, we offer features to make it easy to analyze the code base or just get started with features such as timeline view of code base and summarization of the code base. The latter being extremely helpful to onboard new developers. 

Behind the scenes we use a mix of technologies including vector databases and LLM to answer your questions. Weâ€™ve done some intelligent optimizations that we can serve summarization, analysis, and Q&A within the same stack.

## Example of questions for Archie

- **How is a specific feature implemented?**
  - Learn how complex features like Tree-sitter or streaming responses are implemented in open-source repositories, saving you time when implementing similar features in your own codebase.
  - Understand the benefits and drawbacks of the current implementation.
  - Ask for simpler implementations or pseudocode to help you improve your own code.

- **How can I rewrite the implementation of a particular feature?**
  - Get suggestions on improving the implementation of features like "download code from GitHub" in your repository.
  - Say you're more familiar with Python but need to understand a repo in Golang. You can use Archie AI to translate the code in Python.

- **Generate a summary for your codebase:**
  - Quickly understand the overall structure and key components of your project.
  - Identify the main modules, classes, and functions in your codebase.

## How to get most out of the product

- **Be specific:**
  - For example to understand a feature implementation including function name or description would help the tool help you better.

- **Try rephrasing:**
  - At times, while trying to be helpful, the product can be stuck. Trying rephrasing your question to help you.
