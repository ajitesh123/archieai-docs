Welcome to this tutorial on using Archie AI! In this guide, we'll walk you through the three major features of Archie AI: **Explain Code**, **AutoFix**, and **PR Review**. Whether you're looking to understand a codebase, automatically fix issues, or streamline your PR review process, Archie AI has you covered.

## 1. Explain Code

### Step 1: Choose a Repository

Start by selecting a repository. Archie AI provides a list of trending repositories to explore, or you can bring in your own public or private repositories (GitHub or GitLab). For private repositories, you'll need to import them directly.

### Step 2: Get a Summary

Once you've selected your repository, Archie AI will generate a comprehensive summary. This process may take some time, as it involves analyzing the entire codebase to identify the top features and how they are implemented.

### Step 3: Ask Questions

After reviewing the summary, you can ask specific questions about the code. For example, you might ask, "How is AST implemented in this repo?" Archie AI will provide detailed responses based on the codebase.

### Step 4: Explore Follow-Up Questions

Archie AI offers follow-up questions to help you delve deeper into the codebase and understand it more thoroughly.

## 2. AutoFix

### Step 1: Assign an Issue

With AutoFix, you can assign a GitHub issue to Archie AI, and it will automatically work on solving it. You can configure Archie AI to pick up issues with a specific label or title prefix, making it easy to manage.

### Step 2: Watch Archie AI in Action

Once assigned, Archie AI will clean up the issue description, provide a task breakdown, design a solution, implement the changes, and create a pull request (PR) for you to review.

### Step 3: Review the PR

The PR generated by Archie AI is designed to meet the requirements, but you can still make additional tweaks if needed. This feature is particularly useful for tackling repetitive or complex issues, saving you significant time and effort.

## 3. PR Review

### Step 1: Connect to GitHub or GitLab

To start using the PR Review feature, connect Archie AI to your GitHub or GitLab account. You'll need to configure access to the repositories you want Archie AI to review.

### Step 2: Configure Review Settings

Customize how Archie AI reviews your PRs. You can set it to review every PR, update summaries and titles, add inline code suggestions, and more. You can also ignore bot-generated PRs or draft PRs to reduce noise.

### Step 3: Define Best Practices

Define your organization's best practices, such as avoiding print statements in favor of logging or flagging the use of new libraries. Archie AI will enforce these practices during the review process.

### Step 4: Review PRs

When a PR is submitted, Archie AI provides a summary of critical changes, aligned with best practices. It identifies issues, offers recommendations, and even suggests commitable code changes.

### Step 5: Utilize Additional Features

Archie AI supports a variety of commands to enhance your PR reviews, such as asking questions, describing the PR, performing incremental reviews, and finding similar issues. Simply type `help` to see the full list of commands.

## Conclusion

Archie AI is designed to simplify and enhance your software development process, from understanding code to automatically fixing issues and conducting thorough PR reviews. We encourage you to explore these features and see how Archie AI can streamline your workflows. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
