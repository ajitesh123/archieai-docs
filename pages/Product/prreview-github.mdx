### Examples of Archie AI's PR Review
1. Archie AI caught a critical issue in our code where it identified missing fallback logic, which could lead to potential misconfigurations. This kind of insight helps developers catch subtle but impactful errors, ensuring more reliable code.

3.  Archie AI here picked a common oversight where variables are conditionally or locally assigned, leading to potential undefined variable errors. AI can help detect such issues more consistently than humans by thoroughly analyzing the code for these subtle errors.
