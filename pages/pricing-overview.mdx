# Pricing Overview

At Archie AI, we've designed our pricing plans to be usage-based, straightforward, and affordable.

## Our Pricing Plans

We offer three flexible pricing tiers to cater to different needs:

### Free Plan

Perfect for small teams and individual developers who want to try out our features without any commitment.

#### Includes:
- âœ… **PR Reviews**: Get up to 100 pull request reviews each month.
- âœ… **Unlimited Q&As**: Ask as many questions as you need about your codebase.
- âœ… **Repo Size Limit**: Manage repositories up to 500 MiB.

Start for free and experience the benefits firsthand! We do use a small-size model for this tier, which makes it possible for use to offer this tier at no cost. It's the most generous free tier in the industry.

### Starter Plan ðŸš€

**Ideal for growing teams that need more power and flexibility.**

**$20 Credit Top-up (Minimum)**
#### Includes:
- âœ… **100** pull request reviews each month
- âœ… **1,000** questions about your codebase
- âœ… **100** automatic issue fixes each month
- âœ… **Unlimited** repository size

If you're just using Archie AI for PR Review, then you effectively are paying $0.2 per PR review. If you need higher limits, you can always top up your credits.

This tier uses **advanced models such as Anthropic Sonnet 3.5 or OpenAI 01-mini**, and that results in a big quality uptick. Upgrade to the Starter plan and take your projects to the next level!

## The Archie AI Advantage

### Simple, Usage-Based Pricing
Scale your team without worrying about per-seat costs. Our straightforward pricing means you only pay for the pull requests you review.

### Cost Comparison

Traditional PR review tools can get expensive quickly with their per-seat pricing model. For example, a 5-person team reviewing 100 PRs monthly typically pays $50-100, with additional costs for AI bot seats.

| Features | Traditional Tools | Archie AI |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Base Cost | $75/month (5 seats) | âœ… $20 |
| Seat Pricing | $10-20/seat | âœ… No seat costs |
| AI Bot Seats | Additional cost | âœ… Included |
| Scaling | Fixed monthly cost | âœ… Pay as you grow |
| Team Size | Limited by seats | âœ… Unlimited |
</div>
