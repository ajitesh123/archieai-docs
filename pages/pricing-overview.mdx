# Pricing Overview

At Archie AI, we've designed our pricing plans to be usage-based, straightforward, and affordable.

## Our Pricing Plans

We offer three flexible pricing tiers to cater to different needs:

### Free Plan

Perfect for small teams and individual developers who want to try out our features without any commitment.

- **PR Reviews**: Get up to 100 pull request reviews each month.
- **Unlimited Q&As**: Ask as many questions as you need about your codebase.
- **Repo Size Limit**: Manage repositories up to 500 MiB.

Start for free and experience the benefits firsthand! We do use a small-size model for this tier, which makes it possible for use to offer this tier at no cost. It's the most generous free tier in the industry. 

### Starter Plan

**Ideal for growing teams that need more power and flexibility.**

$20 Credit Top-up (Minimum) gets you:
- **Up to 100** pull request reviews each month
- **Up to 1,000** questions about your codebase
- **Up to 100** automatic issue fixes each month
- **Unlimited** repository size

If you're just using Archie AI for PR Review, then you effectively are paying $0.2 per PR review. 

This tier uses **advanced models such as Anthropic Sonnet 3.5 or OpenAI 01-mini**, and that results in a big quality uptick. Upgrade to the Starter plan and take your projects to the next level!

### Enterprise Plan

Designed for large organizations that require advanced features and dedicated support.

- **PR Reviews**: Over 1,000 pull request reviews each month.
- **Autofix Queries**: Over 1000 bug fixes each month
- **Unlimited Chat**: Unlimited Q&As with your codebase.
- **Enterprise Support**: Benefit from priority customer support tailored to your needs.
- **Self-Hosting Option**: Choose to host our services on your own infrastructure for added security and control.

## Why Our Pricing Stands Out

The tech market is bustling with similar features and options, making it challenging to find the best value. Here's how we make it easier for you:

- **Simple and Clear**: Our pricing is easy to understand with no hidden fees or complicated terms.
- **Affordable for Everyone**: Our usage-based pricing eliminates the pricing burden that seat-based pricing puts on teams. 
- **Friction-Free Start**: No hassle of entering credit card details or agreeing to lengthy terms and conditions.

Most of our peer tools charge $10-20 per seat. That means even for a 5 member team who just churns 100 PRs per month, you end up paying $50-100. If you have multiple AI bots raising PRs, then you also pay for their seats. 

With Archie AI, you start at $20 for 100 PRs and simply add more credits as your needs grow. We grow only when you benefit, making our pricing truly aligned with your success.
