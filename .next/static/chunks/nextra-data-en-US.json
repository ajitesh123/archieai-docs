In addition, we offer features to make it easy to analyze the code base or just get started with features such as timeline view of code base and summarization of the code base. The latter being extremely helpful to onboard new developers.Behind the scenes we use a mix of technologies including vector databases and LLM to answer your questions. Weâ€™ve done some intelligent optimizations that we can serve summarization, analysis, and Q&A within the same stack.You can view the video here.","example-of-questions-for-archie#Example of questions for Archie":"How is a specific feature implemented?\nLearn how complex features like Tree-sitter or streaming responses are implemented in open-source repositories, saving you time when implementing similar features in your own codebase.\nUnderstand the benefits and drawbacks of the current implementation.\nAsk for simpler implementations or pseudocode to help you improve your own code.\nHow can I rewrite the implementation of a particular feature?\nGet suggestions on improving the implementation of features like \"download code from GitHub\" in your repository.\nSay you're more familiar with Python but need to understand a repo in Golang. You can use Archie AI to translate the code in Python.\nGenerate a summary for your codebase:\nQuickly understand the overall structure and key components of your project.\nIdentify the main modules, classes, and functions in your codebase.","how-to-get-most-out-of-the-product#How to get most out of the product":"Be specific:\nFor example to understand a feature implementation including function name or description would help the tool help you better.\nTry rephrasing:\nAt times, while trying to be helpful, the product can be stuck.
