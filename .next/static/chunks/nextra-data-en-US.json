This kind of insight helps developers catch subtle but impactful errors, ensuring more reliable code.\nArchie AI identified a critical issue in our async code where using asyncio.sleep(0) could lead to unexpected behavior under heavy load.\nArchie AI here picked a common oversight where variables are conditionally or locally assigned, leading to potential undefined variable errors. AI can help detect such issues more consistently than humans by thoroughly analyzing the code for these subtle errors."}}}
